# Drug Screen Analyzer

Drug Screen Analyzer tool uses GR Metrics Library (<https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GRmetrics.html>). This tool expects the file to be in Case A format. An example I have attached in the data folder.

**Note-The column is called agent not treatment. In case you download the example from http://www.grcalculator.org/grcalculator/

### GR Metrics and GR Values 

You can select the input file and output directory. Then select the checkbox for the file you want. Click the button and files will be generated in the output directory.

### Graphs

You can select the "Generate Graph" tab and it will automatically show the agents name. You can select multiple checkboxes and select option "Generate Individual Agent Graphs" to generate graphs per agent or "Generate Combined Agent Graph" to make one graph for selected agents.

### Displan GR Values

The agents will be automatically loaded. You can select the interesting column name by default the value is select to - GR50, GR_AOC, AUC. You can also select Copy to clipboard option to easily paste it to Excel.
